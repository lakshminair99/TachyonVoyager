## Who I am:
_My name is Lakshmi Devaraj Nair, born and raised in a small town in Kerala (south of India) and currently living in Germany. Writing began as a hobby in 2023. I love nature, philosophy, human psychology, health and travel. Through this blog I hope to share the knowledge I acquired on these topics. Since 2025 I'm also trying to integrate the philosophy of non duality into my life which has brought immense amount of peace and wellbeing.

_I'm happy to connect with you through my writing:)_

## Why Tachyon Voyager?
_Tachyon is a hypothetical particle that is theorized to always move faster than the speed of light. Voyager is humanity's farthest reaching explorer. I chose the name Tachyon Voyager to symbolize moving beyond boundaries to explore relentless new knowledge._
