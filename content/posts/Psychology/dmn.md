I often wondered why each of us has a unique sense of self, and what purpose it served us. Caution: 'self' and 'sense of self' are two different concepts. So let me start with the difference between the two. Self is your entire identity, including your body, personality, traits, history, and everything that makes you who you are. 

## But your sense of self is the 'I' or the 'me' or the 'you' who thinks, feels, acts and has own memory and experiences in life. Sense of self is your conscious experience or feeling of being you!

When we refer to 'me', 'my pen', 'my story', 'my friend' , then it is the sense of self surfacing in our awareness. It is nearly impossible to define a person without making references to his/her life experiences, memories, beliefs etc. Pause and consider for a moment — who are you without your thoughts, feelings, identity, and awareness of being you across time? Without these you would be most likely be just an organism operating on insticts. So clearly there is a purpose for the sense of 'self'. What is this purpose?  We will explore what results in too much of this sense of self and how to manage it optimally. 

According to philosophies such as non-duality, the sense of a separate self is a mental construct: a story created by thoughts, memory, and identification. Just like colors doesn’t exist in reality and are rather our brains way of interpreting different wavelengths of visible light, it is said that sense of self could also be a virtual construct - an internal simulation created by our brain using sensory, emotional, cognitive, and social inputs. Isn’t it fascinating that such philosophies existed for centuries, long before emerging fields like contemplative neuroscience were even conceived?

It was while reading the book “Conscious” by Annaka Harris, I came across the term Default Mode Network (DMN) which was found to be the central neural correlate of the “self” or “ego” in the brain. While many different brain regions contribute to self-referential processing, looks like DMN deserves our attention on this matter. DMN is the interconnected brain regions that work together when the brain is at rest and our focus is inward like during a self reflective state. 
## According to state of the art researches, DMN plays a major role with the self referential aspects of our conscious experience. 
In short, more the activity in the DMN, heightened is the sense of self. It is simply our brains story teller and the story is always about the self.

I must also say that DMN is a multi tasker. It has served its purpose in evolution by helping us anticipate threats, collaborate in groups, learn from the past and strategize for the future which are all big evolutionary advantages in complex social environments. However, today we are far less exposed to physical danger that evolution was once worried about, but rather more exposed to mental and social stress which causes the DMN to not shut off and instead to keep replaying, comparing, and anticipating for reasons that the brain correlates to survival. Therefore, its overactivity is also the reason for rumination (repetitive thoughts), mental time travel (dwelling on the past, worrying about the future), creating narratives about who we are and what life means etc. 

If you are creating or replaying internal stories or narratives, you now know that your DMN is at work! ;) 

Long story short, one of the reasons why we are often stuck in “me centered" loops is because of overactive DMN. It could be as simple as imagining future scenarios involving yourself or simply mental time traveling. 
## Studies shows that suppressing DMN activity has proven to suppress the sense of self in humans. 
Psychedelic substances also has similar effects on our brains. But is it possible to reduce the DMN activity without substance abuse? The good news is YES. Studies also point to the direction that practices like meditation has immense effect on reducing the DMN activity and thereby reducing the sense of self. 

As we have seen, the sense of self is serving us in many different ways. But it is reasonable to believe that the dose makes the poison. Compared to our ancestors, we don't need too much DMN activity to survive. When we start to train ourselves to observe our thoughts, actions, emotions and feelings with awareness, we begin to step away from the mental constructs that shape unwanted self references and thereby getting a step closer to a peaceful, happy and a life full of love. Incorporating mindfulness practices like meditation to our daily routines can do magic in our over all well being.
