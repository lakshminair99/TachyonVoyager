One of the most influential artist of the 20th century, Pablo Picasso’s work was known very well for pushing the boundaries of traditional art. His work was mostly diverse and many contained expressions of emotions aimed at conveying their psychological states. 

After relishing the ample fruits of his successful career, during his old age, Pablo Picasso was sitting at a restaurant scribbling something on a napkin. He was just enjoying the present and effortlessly scribbling something that grasped his attention at that moment. A woman, sitting on the nearby table noticed him. As Picasso finished his coffee and crumbled up the napkin to throw it away, the woman stopped him and asked:

W: “Can I have that napkin you were drawing on? I will pay you for it”

With a calm and gentle voice Picaso replied:

P: “Sure Ma'am, That will be twenty thousand dollars”

The woman was awestruck and said:

W: “Why?? It only took you few minutes to draw it!” 

to which Picasso replied with a smile on his face:

P: “No Ma’am, it took me over 60 years to draw this”. 

The essence of this story is fascinating because just like Picasso's work, every entity comprises of underlying and often overlooked factors that contribute to its creation. 

Every single effort that we take today will accumulate over the years and add value to our future selves.
